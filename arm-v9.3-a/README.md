# Armv9-A Sail specification

This repository contains a Sail version of the [Armv9-A ISA
specification][ARM_ARM].

The files `instrs{32,64}.sail` and `v8_base.sail` in the `src` directory
contain the AArch32 and AArch64 instruction specifications of Armv9-A and the
necessary auxiliary functions, respectively.  These Sail files are derived from
the 2021-12 version of [Arm's ASL specification][ARM_ASL] using the automatic
[ASL-to-Sail][asl_to_sail] translation tool.  This was done using a snapshot of
ASL files provided by Arm; compared to the version of the specification
[available on the Arm website][ARM_ASL], this snapshot consists of plain ASL
files rather than XML files, and it contains automatically generated glue code
connecting system register accessors and system operations to the instruction
semantics (e.g.  `AArch64_AutoGen_SysRegRead`).

In addition, the `src` directory in this repository contains a number of Sail
files (handwritten, not derived from ASL and not part of the official
specification) that allow the generation of an executable emulator.  In
particular, `step.sail` contains a simple top-level fetch-decode-execute
function, and `impdefs.sail` and `map_clauses.sail` contain some default
choices for implementation-defined behaviour.

## Building

To build artifacts derived from the Sail specification, make sure that a recent
version of [Sail][sail] is installed (last tested using revision `b785601e`),
and use the Makefile target `gen_c` to generate an emulator, and `gen_isa` or
`gen_coq` to generate a model for the Isabelle or Coq theorem prover,
respectively.

The `boot/boot.sh` script downloads, builds, and runs a version of the Linux
kernel above the C emulator.

libraries in the `snapshots` directory, which come with their own license files
in their respective subdirectories.
