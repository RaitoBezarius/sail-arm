# Snapshot of Isabelle definitions of 64 bit ARMv8.5-A

This directory contains snapshots of the Isabelle theories generated by Sail
for the base fragment of the [ARM v8.5](aarch64/) specification, currently
excluding 32 bit, floating point, and vector instructions.  This snapshots is
provided for convenience, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date.

A heap image containing the architecture definitions (as well as the Lem and
Sail libraries in the [lem](lem/) subdirectory) can be built using

```
isabelle build -b -d lib -d . Sail-AArch64
```

This takes roughly 20 minutes on an Intel Core i7-7700 with 64GB RAM.

An interactive session based on this heap image can be started using the
following command (replacing `$DIR` with the path of this directory):

```
isabelle jedit -d $DIR/lib -d $DIR -l Sail-AArch64
```

See the [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail),
[Lem](https://github.com/rems-project/lem), and
[Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) websites for more information on those
projects.
