This model uses our new concurrency interface, which expects to use a
bitvector library from stdpp-unstable.  Unfortunately this isn't in opam (it
will be once the library is promoted to the main stdpp library), so a copy
from https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp is required.  The easiest way is to
add their opam repository for the development branch.  Similarly, the stdpp
version of coq-sail is required from https://github.com/rems-project/coq-sail,
which can be installed by an opam pin (e.g., by cloning the repository and
using opam install ./coq-sail-stdpp.opam.

Once that is done, you can build this with the usual `make` and install is with
`make install`. Alternatively, doing `opan pin coq-sail-arm .` at the root will
intall this with opam
