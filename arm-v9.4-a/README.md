# Armv9-A Sail specification (Sail concurrency interface edition)

This repository contains a Sail version of the [Armv9-A ISA
specification][ARM_ARM],
patched to use the sail concurrency interface.

The file `v8_base.sail` in the `src` directory contains the Sail translation of
the shared pseudocode in [Arm's ASL specification][ARM_ASL], and the files
`instrs{32,64}*.sail` contain specifications of the AArch32 instructions, the
AArch64 base instructions, as well as the AArch64 SVE and SME instructions.

These Sail files are derived from the 2023-03 version of [Arm's ASL
specification][ARM_ASL] using the automatic [ASL-to-Sail][asl_to_sail]
translation tool. This was done using a snapshot of ASL files provided by Arm;
compared to the version of the specification [available on the Arm
website][ARM_ASL], this snapshot consists of plain ASL files rather than XML
files, and it contains automatically generated glue code connecting system
register accessors and system operations to the instruction semantics (e.g.
`AArch64_AutoGen_SysRegRead` in `sysregs_autogen.sail`).

It also contains code that is not part of the official architecture, but allows
the generation of an executable emulator. In particular, `fetch.sail` contains
a simple top-level fetch-decode-execute function, and `impdefs.sail` and
`reset.sail` contain some default choices for implementation-defined behaviour
and initial values of system registers.

There are also handwritten Sail files that were not translated from ASL, like
the `devices.sail` file providing the timer interrupts required by the Linux
kernel, or the `mem.sail` and `interface.sail` files connecting ASL's memory
accessor functions to the Sail memory interface.

## Concurrency interface patch

In order to support the sail concurrency interface and its new outcomes,
we add the `src/interface.sail` file, which provides
instantiations for the various Sail outcomes.

We update `v8_base.sail` to use these interfaces,
adding the outcomes and patching the memory events.
This also involves moving some of the type definitions out of `v8_base.sail`
and we place them in `src/types.sail` so they can be loaded first.

Additionally, we patch some places to allow emulator termination in Isla.

## Building

To build artifacts derived from the Sail specification, make sure that a recent
version of [Sail][sail] is installed (last tested using Sail version 0.17.1),
and use the Makefile target `gen_c` to generate an emulator, and `gen_isa` or
`gen_coq` to generate a model for the Isabelle or Coq theorem prover,
respectively.

The `boot/boot.sh` script downloads, builds, and runs a version of the Linux
kernel above the C emulator.
